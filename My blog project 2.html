            One keyword : difference. Everything is different. Let me explain.<br><br>
            Before I become an actual University dude, I was in something called "cegep". 
            Cegep is a place that is between high school and university. 
            It treats their students like high schoolers, but gives them the freedom of work of
            a university student. In cegep, the teachers have more ability to approach their 
            students personally and be patient with their misunderstandings and their questions. 
            <strong>However</strong>, Uni teachers seem to not give a single fuck about what their students 
            think of them. And that's totally fair, in my opinion, considering the fact that they probably 
            have a double amount of students to look after and a bigger pile of work to do and bigger 
            responsabilities in university and outside university too.<br><br>
            Considerning that I'm a computer science student, I'll give an example from my first day in the 
            computer science field &#128516; On my first day, I started with a <em>Calculus 1</em> class. 
            To start off, the teacher's rhythm was <strong>unbelievable!</strong> He would change the subject 
            very fast and wouldn't take much time to see who really understood and who didn't. 
            But again, I understand that they're uni teachers and bla bla bla bla, but I never expected it to 
            be <strong>THAT</strong> fast. I guess I have to adapt.<br>

            <h2 id="firstweek">My First week in UdeM</h2>
                <h6>Posted on 7 September 2021</h6>
        <p>
            One week has passed since my first day in university! It felt a little weird to be finally able 
            to call myself a university student after all the issues that I've been through in highschool 
            and cegep, from self-doubt to low grades. It was one hell of a rollercoaster. However, 
            after all of that, here I am, a student in one of the top 100 universities in the world, 
            in one of the most paid/in demand programs at the moment.<br><br>
            Enough deep thoughts, let's focus on what I saw/learnt during the first week. 
            My impression about my university until now remains the same : the difference makes it a little
            hard to adapt, but I'm sure we'll get through it. Something that surprised me is that there are
            way more international students than I thought there will be. In fact, most of the people that
            I've talked to until now are international students! However, their presence reminds me of one 
            of the things I want to do while I'm in university : Be and exchange student. 
            Yes, I want to travel the world while I'm studying. I want to see new places, new cultures, 
            new streets, new faces. It would be refreshing and also very amusing.<br><br>

            Here we are, suffering all together. It has been hell until now! The amount of knowledge 
            I have to integrate into my mind, especially that it's coming from 5 different subjects 
            in which I have to pass them all with an average of at least 75% in all of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why? Well, in my university there is an orientation called "COOP" in which the student that 
            wants to go in will have the opportunity of getting 3 internships instead of the one that 
            is permitted to you in the general orientation. COOP will help me not only gain some extra 
            experience, but it'll also help me in creating a lot of connections and friendships that could 
            potentially help me in my future and my career.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is why I'll try my best to work hard. I mean, creating this blog from scratch is already 
            a part of the hardwork process since I had no clue what even is HTML, CSS, JS, etc.
            My biggest experience in programming was to create this game from scratch on Vpython in Cegep. 
            <em>Although</em> I didn't do much in the project since it was my friend who did the most of it 
            since he was more knowledgeable than me, but it still counts as relevant experience since I did 
            learn a few things on it. I trust myself and the process because I know it'll be hard in the 
            beginning, but with some hardwork I'll be able to do anything and create whatever I want.
